# Hamming Distance Comparison of Amino Acid Sequences of 10 Organisms

This repository contains the source for a script I wrote to assist in the completion of an assignment for my Biology class. The materials included raw amino acid sequences for 10 organisms, and asked us to analyze the sequences and create a cladogram using our analysis. Our solution was to compare the similarity in the sequences to find out which organism was "most similar" to the others. We accomplished this by

1. Converting the sequences to strings
2. Creating a dictionary of the sequences and their animal names
3. populating data structures to be used in calculating averages of hamming distances
4. Sorting the list, comparing the average of each animal's hamming distance and representing the resultant in a bar graph
